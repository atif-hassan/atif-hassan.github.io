                            <strong>Background:</strong>
                                Ensemble learning&#39;s history traces back to the late 20th century, with the early 1990s
                                marking its inception. The term &quot;ensemble learning&quot; gained prominence in the mid-1990s,
                                with researchers exploring methods to combine diverse models for better generalization.
                                The pioneering work of Leo Breiman in 1996 on bagging (bootstrap aggregating)
                                introduced the idea of training multiple models on bootstrapped subsets of the data,
                                reducing overfitting and improving stability. On the other hand AdaBoost, introduced in
                                1995, became a landmark algorithm, showcasing the power of boosting in enhancing weak
                                learners. Shortly after, boosting algorithms, proposed by Robert Schapire and Yoram
                                Singer, emerged to sequentially train models for correct classification of previously
                                misclassified instances. In the early 2000s, Random Forests, introduced by Leo Breiman,
                                gained prominence as an ensemble technique using decision trees and decorrelating them
                                for improved performance. As machine learning advanced, ensemble methods found
                                applications in diverse fields, showcasing their robustness and adaptability. Ensemble
                                learning continued to evolve, adapting to the rise of deep learning.</br></br>
                                <strong>Details of the talk:</strong>
                                This research talk delves into the rich history of ensemble learning, tracing its evolution as
                                a pivotal concept shaping the landscape of modern machine learning. Beginning with its
                                roots, we explore the foundations laid by early pioneers and unravel the journey of
                                ensemble learning&#39;s integration into the domain of machine learning methodologies. A
                                particular focus is placed on the transformative influence of ensemble learning through
                                bootstrapping and boosting techniques, elucidating their role in enhancing model
                                robustness and performance. These techniques not only contribute to the diversity within
                                ensembles but have played a crucial role in the development of powerful algorithms.
                                Furthermore, the talk investigates how ensemble learning serves as a fundamental
                                building block for contemporary deep neural networks, such as residual networks
                                (ResNets) and dense neural networks (DenseNets). Another intriguing aspect explored is
                                the pervasive presence of ensemble learning in various adnaced facets of deep learning
                                like distributed learning, and federated learning. Through this exploration, the talk aims to
                                unveil the hidden influence of ensemble learning, providing a comprehensive
                                understanding of its historical significance and its integral role in molding the landscape of
                                modern machine learning.

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep Neural Networks deliver the promise of overwhelming generalization performance over a wide variety of tasks like image classification, language modeling, etc. However, the growing size of the networks poses concerns of increasing computational and storage overheads. Besides, parameter redundancy in modern deep networks is well established given  their overparameterized nature. To this end, a number of pruning techniques are widely employed for training neural networks which drop redundant model parameters based on various criteria and deliver comparable model performance. In this talk, we discuss the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which empirically proves the existence of subnetworks (winning tickets) within dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks and outlines a training procedure to arrive at the winning solution by training from scratch. The method is successful in reducing parameter counts by over 90% and as well converging faster than the dense network. The talk shall revolve around an overview of the method along with the experimental details. We also plan to discuss the theoretical aspects of the technique and develop deeper insights on 'what makes the lottery tickets win'.
